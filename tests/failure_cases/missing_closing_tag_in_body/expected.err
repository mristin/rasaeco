When rendering <path to scenario.md>: Failed to parse the scenario markdown converted to HTML: mismatched tag: line 9, column 2; the line was: '</body>', the open tag(s) up to that point: ['<html>', '<body>', '<model name="plan/main">']. Did you maybe forget to close the tag <model name="plan/main">?
